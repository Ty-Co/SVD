Extract the contents of assignment1.zip as well as the files contained within it.
You should have a total of 6 files crucial for running the code:
-t10k-images.idx3-ubyte
-t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte
-train-images.idx3-ubyte
-train-labels.idx1-ubyte
-Project1_TC.m
-readMNIST.m

These files must be in the same directory as the matlab code to work properly

1. Make sure that is a matlab file path to directory
2. Open Project1_TC.m 
	- For best results in terms of analyzing code is to 'Run by section' (reccommended)

Note:	-There will be text compaction in Singular Value graph and Cumlative Graph
should in large photo
	- Distance will be displayed in the command prompt.
	- More results will be present, not present in the report. 

In the html folder extracted from the zip file there will be a 
pdf of the code and accompanying results
